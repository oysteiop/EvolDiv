Dear Team, 
Thanks for your patience with me.  I am attaching two data sets that pertain to the paper in JEB, which I will attach as a pdf.
With these data, additive genetic variances, etc. can be estimated.  The study involved three populations (B: Virginia, CRC: Portugal, ZAG: Croatia) and one trait (calyx width).  We grew seeds from the 3 populations in a greenhouse and hand pollinated each female with a variety of males — males from their own population, and males from each of the other two populations.  Then we grew up seeds (also in the greenhouse) and measured calyx width.
The data file entitled “Calyx width data for new study.xls” gives the following information for the offspring of these crosses: the Cross (who was the dam and sire), a number for the individual, the sex of the individual (Female vs. Male), our plant ID# (the tag on the plant—not worth noting for you), and then calyx width measurements for the same three flowers on each individual, followed by the mean of these three measurements.  The data file entitled “crosses and sex ratio of offspring.xls” gives the actual id for the dam and sire for each of the 145 crosses, and the number of males and females from the growing up of the seeds from each cross.
We found that the Qst/Fst ratio was much higher for males than females, suggesting that calyx width divergence among populations had been driven by selection on males.
I am sure you will need to look these over and read the paper, and then at that point feel free to ask questions.
Cheers,
Lynda
